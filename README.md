# Alfido-Tech Internship
 This repository is a source code for the tasks that were assigned to me for my internship at Alfido Tech. The tasks include the following projects:
 - Weather Data Analysis
 - Uber Data Analysis
 - Inventory Analysis Case
   
 All the tasks were carried out using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Weather Data Analysis 
Weather Data Analysis focuses on examining historical weather data to extract insights and patterns. This could include analyzing temperature trends, precipitation patterns, wind
speeds, and more. 

### Features 
- Examination of historical weather data
- Extraction of insights and patterns
- Analysis of temperature trends
- Study of precipitation patterns
- Evaluation of wind speeds

## Uber Data Analysis
This involves studying data related to Uber rides, such as ride times, locations, and user ratings. The analysis can be used to understand user behavior, driver patterns, and areas of high demand.
